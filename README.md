# Budget-Tracker

## Project Description:

The budget tracker web application is designed to help individuals gain better control over their personal finances by tracking credit card expenses and analyzing spending patterns. The product is geared towards students and young professionals who want a simple and automated way to manage their budgets without manually categorizing every transaction. Unlike traditional spreadsheets or basic budgeting apps, this tool automatically syncs transaction data, organizes spending into meaningful categories, and presents clear visual summaries to help users understand and improve their financial habits.
